=======================

<img src="assets/reuse-243x310.png" alt="" align="left"/>

**re-use** [ˌriːˈjuːz]:

1. _vtr_ To use something that is considered past its usefulness, again.
2. _n_ The act of salvaging or in some manner returning a discarded item into something usable.


**Abstract**: By reconsiderig the Git respository purpose, collaborative teams can go beyond the rollback mecanism it provides and leverage their members mastery to write software that's easier to change in faster and more reliable ways. This article aims at switching views by explaing a few key aspects of the Git behaviour with re-use in mind, and describing a set of Git usage conventions which have proved being helpful in the Acid Labs agile daily practice.

I can't but thank my teammates at [Acid Labs](https://github.com/acidlabs). Without their disposition to experiment, those Git conventions wouldn't be conventions at all.

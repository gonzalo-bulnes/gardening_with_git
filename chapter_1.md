Re-use
------

The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle has been widely adopted across the software development community and most of us try not to write twice the same code, or we eliminate duplication through specific refactoring. However, for those of us who use to work on different projects, not repeating what we write doesn’t mean not repeating ourselves. When implementing popular features in several projects, we still repeatedly add similar dependencies packages, apply similar configurations, and integrate similar options across them. We repeat what we do.

Git does provide mechanisms to avoid that repetition through re-use. Making them obvious requires, however, to shift mindsets about the role of Git in our workflows. Teams often use version control systems to go back when things go wrong, that’s true for Git too. This book proposes you to use Git with re-use in mind, to go forward.
